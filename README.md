## Viability of RPi 2 B as an alternative HPC(High-powered Computing) cluster:

This project will focus on the feasibility of using the RPi 2 B as cost
effective means to create an HPC cluster, examining what types of
appliations this could be used in. By using the Pi 2 B as the Head node,
using the lower powered B+, A+, or older devices could be used to take
several different tasks. If a project calls for a lot of raw data to be
used for one parameter, or another project calls for anylyzing several
types of data, different set ups could be used for what an individual needs. 
All of this would be with cost being as minimal as it would be for a typical
setup.
